Tabs and Content
The webpage includes tabs for each decade.
When clicked, each tab reveals the corresponding life events and other significant details.
The current decade is automatically displayed when the page is loaded, calculated based on the birth date (December 24, 1962).
Google Map Integration
The map is displayed below the decade tabs.
Markers represent significant locations from each decade. Initially, a marker is set for Williston, North Dakota (birthplace).
Additional markers can be added in the initMap function within the <script> tags by specifying latitude, longitude, and title for each new location.
Example to add a new location marker:

javascript
Copy code
new google.maps.Marker({
    position: { lat: 34.0522, lng: -118.2437 }, // Coordinates for Los Angeles, CA
    map: map,
    title: "Significant Location: Los Angeles, CA",
});
